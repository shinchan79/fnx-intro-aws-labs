Try to install and configure wordpress by remote exec, but do not work as expected.

To configure wordpress:
$ wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
$ cd wordpress
$ cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php


$ vi wp-config.php
Replace values of: DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST as in the Terraform output part. 

$ cd /home/ec2-user

$ sudo cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/

$ sudo service httpd restart

and then locate to the dns of the EC2
