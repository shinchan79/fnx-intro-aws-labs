# Create and Configure Your File System
View the storage available on your instance:
```
df -h
```
You should see output similar to:
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

devtmpfs        484M     0  484M   0% /dev

tmpfs           492M     0  492M   0% /dev/shm

tmpfs           492M  460K  491M   1% /run

```
This is showing the original 8GB disk volume. Your new volume is not yet shown.

Create an ext3 file system on the new volume:
```
sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdf
```
Create a directory for mounting the new storage volume:
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store
```
Mount the new volume:
```
sudo mount /dev/sdf /mnt/data-store
```To configure the Linux instance to mount this volume whenever the instance is started, you will need to add a line to /etc/fstab.
```
echo "/dev/sdf   /mnt/data-store ext3 defaults,noatime 1 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```
View the configuration file to see the setting on the last line:
```
cat /etc/fstab
```
View the available storage again:
```
df -h
```
The output will now contain an additional line - /dev/xvdf:
```

devtmpfs        484M     0  484M   0% /dev

```
On your mounted volume, create a file and add some text to it.
```
sudo sh -c "echo some text has been written > /mnt/data-store/file.txt"
```
Verify that the text has been written to your volume.
```
cat /mnt/data-store/file.txt
```
# Create an Amazon EBS Snapshot
In your remote SSH session, delete the file that you created on your volume.
```
sudo rm /mnt/data-store/file.txt
```
Verify that the file has been deleted.
```
ls /mnt/data-store/
```
Your file has been deleted.
# Mount the Restored Volume
Create a directory for mounting the new storage volume:
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store2
```

Mount the new volume:
```
sudo mount /dev/sdg /mnt/data-store2
```
 
Verify that volume you mounted has the file that you created earlier.
```
ls /mnt/data-store2/
```
You should see file.txt.
